Smart Mute – Silent Zone App

An intelligent Android application that automatically switches your phone's sound profile based on location, time, and custom rules.

📱 About the Project

Smart Mute is an Android application designed to automate sound settings such as Silent, Vibrate, and Normal modes without manual input. Using geofencing, scheduled automation, and custom sound profiles, the app ensures the phone adapts to the environment—like classrooms, offices, or libraries.
